# How to Add Your Photo to the Portfolio

## Quick Steps:

### 1. Save Your Photo
- Take the photo you showed me (with the yellow neon background)
- Save it in this project folder (same location as index.html)
- Name it: **profile.jpg**

### 2. That's it!
- Refresh your browser
- Your photo will appear automatically in the About section

## Alternative Method:

If you want to use a different filename:

1. Save your photo with any name (e.g., `bhagya-photo.jpg`)
2. Open `index.html`
3. Find line 177: `<img src="profile.jpg"`
4. Change to: `<img src="bhagya-photo.jpg"`
5. Save and refresh

## Current Status:

Right now you'll see a placeholder with the letter "B" because the photo file doesn't exist yet.

Once you add `profile.jpg`, it will automatically show your beautiful photo with:
- ✨ Animated decorative frames
- 🎨 Gradient effects
- 🔄 Hover animations
- 💫 Professional styling

## Supported Formats:
- .jpg / .jpeg (recommended)
- .png
- .webp

## Recommended Photo Specs:
- **Aspect Ratio:** 3:4 (portrait orientation)
- **Resolution:** At least 800x1000 pixels
- **File Size:** Under 2MB for fast loading

Your photo with the yellow neon background will look amazing! 🎉
